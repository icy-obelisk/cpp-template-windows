# How to use

## Software preparation

1. Install `clang` from Visual Studio Installer (lightweight [Build Tools Edition](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe) is recommended if you don't like using Visual Studio IDE) by searching `clang` in `Individual components` section and select `C++ Clang Compiler for Windows` and `MSBuild support for LLVM toolset`. Don't forget to install `Desktop development with C++`.
2. Add `clang` to `PATH` environment variable, also add Visual Studio built-in `cmake` to `PATH`. Usually 64-bit `clang` is located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin` and `cmake` is located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin` if you install only Visual Studio build tools. Otherwise search them depends on the edition of Visual Studio you've installed.
3. Download `ninja` from [github](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases), put it to your preferred program folder and add it to `PATH`.

Visual Studio version of `lldb` doesn't work so use vscode extension [codelldb](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb) instead.

## Setup environment

```pwsh
. .\env.ps1
```

This will append environment variable `PATH` to run the program directly from the terminal.

## Compile the project

```pwsh
.\compile.ps1
```

This will generate a file named `compile_commands.json` to help clangd to find local header files.

This project use `clang` and `ninja` to build.

## Run the project

```pwsh
cpp-sample.exe
```

Optionally, debug the program using `codelldb`.

## (Optional) Clean the build files

```pwsh
.\clean.ps1
```

This will remove build files generated by `cmake`.

# Recommended IDE

I personally use `vscodium` with the following extensions:

```plain text
clangd - made by llvm
    Autocomplete/Format C++ code

CMake - made by twxs
    Autocomplete CMake code

CodeLLDB - made by vadimcn
    Debug C++ programs
```
